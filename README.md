# Quick-Sort
Objectives:
• Implement basic quick sort algorithm
• Implement quick sort using median of 3 partitioning
• Compare the performance of insertion sort, merge sort, heap sort, and quick sort.
Problems
1. Implement a method to sort a given array using the basic quicksort algorithm.
2. Write a driver program to test the quicksort algorithm for the file uploaded.
3. Compare the performance of the quicksort algorithm with 3 cases of input files:
sorted, reversed sorted, and random. These files are provided in the
Quicksort Input Files folder.
4. Use the median of 3 partitioning algorithm to implement
quick sort. This algorithm chooses the pivot element as the median of the 3
elements namely: A[p], A[r], and A[(p+r)/2].
5. Compare the performance of the quicksort using median of 3 partitioning with the
basic quicksort algorithm using the input files located in Quicksort Input
Files folder.
6. Compare the execution time of quicksort with the execution time of insertion sort,
merge sort, heap sort. Make sure you use the same array to compare the
performance. Use a table or plot to summarize the results and document your
observations and analysis in the report. You can use the input files ranging from 100
to 500,000 or the input files ranging from 16 to 8192.
